# Data-Structures

This repository aims to implement popular data structures with python programming language Version 3

## Season 1 - Introduction and Efficiency
Efficiency: In Algorithm Concept, It is also called Complexity. It is how well you are using your computer resources to get a particular job done. We can Think about it in terms of Space (How Much Storage Space Needed?) and Time (How Long the Code takes to Run?).

The important Tradeoff in Algorithms:

1. Time Efficiency
2. Storage Space Efficiency

Open an Algorithm Book and read the Complexity Notations which we use for explaining algorithms complexity too in this repository

This season is Done!

## Season 2 - List-based Collection

The main Work starts from this point. Be Ready for Coding and Enjoying DS and DA :)
